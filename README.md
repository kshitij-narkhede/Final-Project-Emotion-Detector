# Emotion Detection Web Application

## Overview

Welcome to your final project! This project will showcase your skills in app development and web deployment. You’ll create an emotion detection application using Watson AI libraries and deploy it as a web app with Flask. Follow the tasks below to complete the project and submit your work as instructed.

## Emotion Detection

Emotion detection identifies nuanced emotions such as joy, sadness, and anger from text, extending beyond basic sentiment analysis. This capability is essential for AI-driven systems like recommendation engines and chatbots. For this project, you’ll leverage Watson AI to develop an emotion detection application.

## Project Tasks
